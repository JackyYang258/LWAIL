### Environment Setting


### Model and datasets
We provide our basic ICVF model in model which you can directly load them. For other variant models, please refer to the other codebase ICVF-PyTorch for training code of the model.()

For datasets, due to the capacity of github repo, we provide our standard one trajectory dataset. You can look for scripts under folder datasets for how to get those trajectories

### How to run the experiments

bash run.bash

For a quick reimplement of the main experiment, you can run

bash all_run.bash
